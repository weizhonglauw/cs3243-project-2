## Sudoku Puzzle Solver

Basic implementation of sudoku puzzle solver is completed using bactracking search with forward checking and ac3 algo to improve efficiency. Current implementation is still slower than the benchmark, although not super significant.

More work needs to be done to make the solver more efficient.
